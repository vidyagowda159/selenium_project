						POP UPS

Alert/Confirmation/Java Script pop up
Alert is a small message box which displays on-screen notification to give the user some kind of information or ask for permission to perform certain kind of operation. It may be also used for warning purpose.
Characteristics of alert pop up:
•	We cannot inspect the pop-up
•	We can move the pop-up
•	It contains minimise, maximise and close buttons.
•	It contains only one button (‘YES’ or ‘NO’) or two buttons (‘Cancel’ and ‘OK’).
•	This kind of pop-up is also called as web based pop-up and javascript pop-up.
•	In order to perform operation on the alert pop-up, we first transfer the control from webpage to the pop-up.
•	Selenium provides us with a class called Alert.
